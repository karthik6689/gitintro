Structured language specifications

● The freedom of the requirements writer is limited by a predefined template for requirements.

● All requirements are written in a standard way.

● The terminology used in the description may be limited.

● The advantage is that the most of the expressiveness of natural language is maintained but a degree of uniformity is imposed on the specification
